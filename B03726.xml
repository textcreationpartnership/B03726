            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To his Grace, His Majesties high Commiſſioner, and the Right Honourable the Eſtates of Parliament. <hi>The PETITION of Alexander Hunter <hi>of</hi> Muirhouſe,</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>Humbly ſheweth,</opener>
            <p>THat where the deceaſt Mr. <hi>Alexander Hamilton</hi> my Grand-father, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided me to the ſum of ten thouſand Pounds <hi>Scots</hi> Money, and thereafter I was married to <hi>Barbara Moncreiff,</hi> with whom I had the like ſum of ten thouſand Pounds of Tochar, both which, and eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Merks with my Mother, were uplifted by the deceaſt Mr. <hi>James Hunter</hi> of <hi>Muirhouſe</hi> my Father, and applyed to his own proper uſe. In remunera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, my Father did ſecure me in the ſum of an hundred Pound <hi>sterl.</hi> yearly, out of the Lands of <hi>Muirhouſe,</hi> during his Lifetime, and provided me to the Fee of the ſaid hail Lands, extending to twenty eight Chalder of Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or thereby of yearly Rent. And my Father being involved in great and conſiderable ſums of Money, far exceeding the Value and Eſtate of <hi>Muirhouſe,</hi> and all his other Real and Perſonal Eſtate, did induce me to engage, as Principal and Cautioner for him, in the greateſt part of all his Debts. And from term to term, when new Bonds were ſubſcribing, he made me believe, that the ſums borrowed at theſe terms were to ſatisfie and clear off other Creditors, to whom I was formerly bound for him. And I being bound in duty, not to diſtruſt any thing which my Father ſaid, never made any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enquiry, but believed that when I ſubſcribed new Bonds, they came in place of former, neither did I ever doubt the ſame, until the time of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſickneſs, (whereof he died,) and then it did but too evidently appear, to my ſad experience, that there was little or no part of the ſums wherein I was firſt engaged for my Father, ſatisfied and taken off by the Money borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereafter. By which means, though there was none of the ſums, for which I was engaged for my Father, applyed to my uſe: Yet I was neceſſitate (to prevent the rigorous Diligence of Creditors) to take Sanctuary in the <hi>Abbay,</hi> ever ſince my Fathers death. And ſeing your Petitioner was moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently inveigled by the Perſwaſions of his Father, out of the duty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which he owed to him, without making any enquiry into the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Affairs, whereby I am a greater loſer my ſelf by far, than any of his Creditors: In reſpect any Fortune I had <hi>aliundi,</hi> by my Grand-father and Wife, (which was conſiderable, as is above mentioned) being ſwallowed up in that gulf of Debts due by my Father. And it being the cuſtome of all Nations in the World, when Debitors become inſolvent by misfortune, and

               <!-- PDF PAGE 46 -->without uſing any fraudulent or ſiniſtrous Methods, to grant them perſonal Liberty, which were very hard to deny in a caſe ſo circumſtantiat as mine: Eſpecially I being willing inſtantly to diſpone to my Fathers Creditors, all Eſtate, Real and Perſonal belonging to my ſelf, or that can accreſs to me any manner of way, through the deceaſe of my Father, and to denude my ſelf of the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

And likewiſe ſince my continuance under Reſtraint can never advance the intereſt of my Fathers Creditors, neither can my perſonal Protection prejudge them; But on the contrary, if I were at liberty, I would concur with them, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Fathers Fortune effectual for payment of his Debts. As alſo by the favour and aſſiſtance of Friends, I may be advanced to ſome Employment, whereby I may have a Livelyhood for my ſelf and Family.</p>
            <p>May it therefore pleaſe your Grace, and Lordſhips, to take my Caſe and Circumſtances to your ſerious Conſideration, and upon my ſigning of the foreſaid Diſpoſition; to grant me perſonal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection during all the days of my Life time, for ſuch Debts and Sums of Money, as I was reſting at the time of my Fathers deceaſe. And to diſcharge Meſſengers, and other Officers, to put any Caption or Acts of Warding in execution againſt me, for the Cauſes foreſaid. And your Grace and Lordſhips Anſwer is humbly prayed for.</p>
